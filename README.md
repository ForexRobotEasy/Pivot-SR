# Pivot SR ReadMe File

## Introduction
This is a code sample for the Pivot SR indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This indicator calculates pivot, support, and resistance levels based on the selected timeframe. The code also includes functions for determining entry points, calculating take profit and stop loss levels, handling errors, and integrating with existing trading systems.

## Custom Indicator
The `CustomIndicator` function is responsible for calculating the pivot, support, and resistance levels based on the selected timeframe. Users can add their own code to this function to customize the calculation method. The function should return the calculated levels.

## Overlay on Chart
The `OverlayOnChart` function is used to overlay the calculated pivot, support, and resistance lines onto the chart. Users can add their own code to customize the appearance of the lines.

## Trading Functions
The code includes several trading functions for determining entry points, calculating take profit and stop loss levels, and handling errors.

### DetermineEntryPoints
The `DetermineEntryPoints` function takes the calculated pivot, support, and resistance levels as parameters and determines entry points based on price reactions at these levels. Users can customize the entry point calculation method by adding their own code to this function.

### CalculateTakeProfit
The `CalculateTakeProfit` function calculates the take profit level based on the entry price. The code uses a predefined constant `TP_LEVEL` to determine the take profit distance from the entry price.

### CalculateStopLoss
The `CalculateStopLoss` function calculates the stop loss level based on the entry price. The code uses a predefined constant `SL_LEVEL` to determine the stop loss distance from the entry price.

## Error Handling
The code includes an empty `HandleErrors` function, which users can fill with their own code to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.

## Integration Functions
The code includes an empty `IntegrateWithExistingSystems` function, which users can fill with their own code to integrate the Pivot SR indicator with their existing trading systems.

## Main Program
The `OnStart` function is the main entry point of the program. It calls the `CustomIndicator` function to calculate the pivot, support, and resistance levels, overlays the calculated lines onto the chart, determines entry points based on the calculated levels, calculates take profit and stop loss levels, handles errors and exceptions, and integrates with existing trading systems.
